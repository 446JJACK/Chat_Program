#TO DO LIST FOR CLIENT SIDE CODE

--------

AJAX
-------
1) ajax is reading in json data, just have to give it the python url that returns json
2) need to figure out how to get more than one item to appear in div.
3) got date and time to show up, but need to figure out a good format.

User Interface
---------------
1) Check number 2 in AJAX
2) text bar moves when screen is normal sized.
   Maybe we can fix this to keep it on the bottom.

Javascript
-----------
1) Adding in some ajax broke the chat.
   Hitting enter to submit a message displays the text value,
   but hitting the button runs the functions that carry out the async javascript.
   This replaces the messages with the JSON data.

2) We're expecting JSON data to be returned from the database, so we need to figure out a plan of attack.
